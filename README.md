# Twitter-Bot-Template
A base template for creating a Twitter-Bot

To avoid getting banned from Twitter, for bot like activity, I incorperated modular arithmetic. The latter is used to randomize and vary the intervals in which the bot tweets so that it can continually tweet for a while without being kicked off. I aslo incoporated the capability to tweet previously stated tweets using a user-input base word search, provided by the twitter REST API.
